# SOC-2-Backup-Utility

This repository contains a script for implementing a backup strategy that meets the requirements of SOC 2 Type II compliance. The script utilizes rsync, tar, and openssl to perform incremental file-based backups, compress and encrypt the data, and store it in a specified destination. The script also includes error handling and notification capabilities through email alerts and log file updates. Use this tool to ensure the backup of sensitive data and achieve compliance with the SOC 2 Type II framework.

# Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the script up and running on your local machine for testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

- rsync
- tar
- openssl
- inotify-tools
- gpg
- mailutils

## Installing

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/securelayer7/SOC-2-Backup-Utility.git`
2. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository: `cd SOC-2-Backup-Utility`
3. Edit the script to specify the source and destination directories, email address, log file, and password file.
4. Make the script executable: `chmod +x backup.sh`
5. Run the script: `./backup.sh`

## Cronjob

To set up a cron job for the SOC 2 Backup Utility script, follow these steps:

- Open a terminal and enter the following command to edit the crontab file: `crontab -e`
- Add a line to the crontab file specifying the schedule and command for running the script. For example, to run the script every day at midnight: `0 0 * * * /path/to/backup.sh`

## Security Settings
To store the password in an encrypted form, you can use a tool like gpg to encrypt the password and store it in a separate file. gpg is a command-line utility that allows you to encrypt and decrypt files using public key cryptography.

Here is an example of how you can use gpg to encrypt the password and store it in a separate file:

### Generate a new GPG key pair
`gpg --full-generate-key`

### Enter your name, email address, and choose a password when prompted

### Export the public key
`gpg --export -a "Your Name <your@email.com>" > public.key`

### Encrypt the password using the public key
`echo -n "yourpassword" | gpg --encrypt --recipient "Your Name <your@email.com>" > password.gpg`

## Deployment

To use this script in a production environment, add it to your crontab to run on a schedule.
